CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  cmake_minimum_required() should be called prior to this top-level project()
  call.  Please see the cmake-commands(7) manual for usage documentation of
  both commands.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/GTest/GTestConfig.cmake:37 (if):
  if given arguments:

    "ON"

  An argument named "ON" appears in a conditional statement.  Policy CMP0012
  is not set: if() recognizes numbers and boolean constants.  Run "cmake
  --help-policy CMP0012" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command to
  set the policy and suppress this warning.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  tests/CMakeLists.txt:1 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No cmake_minimum_required command is present.  A line of code such as

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.28)

  should be added at the top of the file.  The version specified may be lower
  if you wish to support older CMake versions for this project.  For more
  information run "cmake --help-policy CMP0000".
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at tests/CMakeLists.txt:3 (add_executable):
  Policy CMP0003 should be set before this line.  Add code such as

    if(COMMAND cmake_policy)
      cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW)
    endif(COMMAND cmake_policy)

  as early as possible but after the most recent call to
  cmake_minimum_required or cmake_policy(VERSION).  This warning appears
  because target "EventLib.Tests" links to some libraries for which the
  linker must search:

    Threads::Threads

  and other libraries with known full path:

    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgtest_main.a

  CMake is adding directories in the second list to the linker search path in
  case they are needed to find libraries from the first list (for backwards
  compatibility with CMake 2.4).  Set policy CMP0003 to OLD or NEW to enable
  or disable this behavior explicitly.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0003" for
  more information.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/GTest/GTestTargets.cmake:71 (set_target_properties):
  Policy CMP0028 is not set: Double colon in target name means ALIAS or
  IMPORTED target.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0028" for policy details.
  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  The link interface of target "GTest::gtest" contains:

    Threads::Threads

  but the target was not found.  Possible reasons include:

    * There is a typo in the target name.
    * A find_package call is missing for an IMPORTED target.
    * An ALIAS target is missing.

Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/GTest/GTestConfig.cmake:42 (include)
